                <p>I’m a frontend web developer with 2+ years of experience based in London. A  creative problem solver and critical thinker, I’m keen to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of the web. A people person that loves working as part of a team, but equally content to get my head down and crack on flying solo too.</p>
